Section 12 - Reactive Forms in Angular

- we were using templates on the project. now we will use reactive Forms
- reactive forms will help us to design forms on the .ts components itself

lab 124 Introduction to Reactive forms in Angular
*. on SPA, goto register/register.component.ts
*. create a field registerForm: FormGroup;
*. create FormControls inside FormGroup on the ngInit
*. goto app.module.ts Add ReactiveFormsModule on the imports Section
*. now update the register.component.html with FormGroup and other changes

lab 125: Validation in Reactive forms
*. goto register.component.ts add validator FormControl('Hello', Validators.required

- for password we need to create a custom validator
lab 126: Custom Validators in Reactive forms
*. goto register.component.ts and add passwordMatchValidator
*. add , this.passwordMatchValidator); to the FormGroup on the ngOnInut

lab 127: Providing Validation feedback to the user
*. goto register.component.html and add ngClass for validation for showing up invalid-feedback div
*. for password field do 3 ngif conditions for checking required, min and max length  for showing up invalid-feedback div
*. the confirm password is bit complex -  1st is required and next is mismatch
